                    to incorporate ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot, and various APIs to
                    streamline the development process and enhance the app's

              <h3 class="h4">team formation</h3>
              <p>
                Participants will sign up individually, and based on the volume
                of interest, we will form one or more balanced teams per office
                location. Each team will include a mix of role. This approach
                encourages cross-discipline collaboration and helps ensure that
                each team has the necessary skills to complete their app.

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h4">pre-event preparations</h3>
              <p>
                Team members are allowed to arrange licenses and learn
                technologies in advance, but they must not write any code for
                their team's app prior to the event's start time. This ensures a
                level playing field for all participants.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h4">cross-discipline collaboration</h3>
              <p>
                There are no strict boundaries for team members to stick to
                their primary discipline during the event. We encourage
                participants to be flexible and contribute to various aspects of
                the project as needed, fostering creativity and collaboration
                within the team.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h4">time</h3>
              <p>
                Each team will have exactly 180 minutes to plan, design, and
                develop their app. This includes design, coding, testing, and
                finalizing the prototype. Teams must ensure they complete their
                work within the allotted time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h4">code submission</h3>
              <p>
                Upon completion of the development phase, teams must commit
                their final code to a project in WillowTree's GitHub account.
                This will enable the organization to view the work and learn
                from the teams' experiences.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="h4">post-development activities</h3>
              <p>
                After the development phase, team members should take some time
                to synthesize their learnings and prepare a presentation to
                share their experiences, insights, and the app's functionality
                with the organization.

              <p>
                To demonstrate the potential of AI tools, we encourage
                participants to use AI technologies like ChatGPT and GitHub
                CoPilot as much as possible throughout the event. Be creative in
                finding ways to integrate these tools into your development
                process and maximize their impact on your project.

                  You're welcome to use any open source tooling or libraries
                  that exist, but your application's own source code should all
                  be written “from scratch” during the hackathon.

                  Our main goal is to foster enthusiasm, experiment, and learn.
                  There won't be set criteria with 1st, 2nd, 3rd place, etc.,
                  but there will be awards in different categories.

                  One of our goals for this current hackathon is to understand
                  how AI tooling affects the processes of teams collaborating
                  together, so for this one, registered participants will be put
                  into teams based on office and/or time zone. However, that
                  does not mean you can't experiment with things on your own! If
                  you do something fun that you want to share, we have a page
                  for that in our Confluence space too. There's also the
                  potential for future hackathons of a different format, goal,
                  etc. pending the outcomes of this one.

                  WFA Trees will be on teams with other WFA Trees, with an
                  effort to group teams by time zone (pending volume of
                  registered attendees). The hope is that WFN Trees will be able
                  to find time during in-office days the week of the hackathon
                  to participate. A DRI per-location will be responsible for
                  coordinating schedules.
